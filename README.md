# 🧑‍💻 Steven Kebila – Developer Portfolio

Welcome to the source code for my personal developer portfolio, built to showcase my work as a **Full-Stack Software Engineer** and **Creative Technologist**.

This site reflects both the technical depth of my experience (backend-first mindset with strong frontend skills) and my creative work in music, startups, and digital products.

## 🖼️ About This Portfolio

Built with performance and clarity in mind, this portfolio is designed to:

- Showcase featured projects (backend, frontend, creative tools)
- Present my dev experience in a clean, square aesthetic
- Offer quick access to my resume, GitHub, and LinkedIn
- Highlight startup/product experience (Launchab, Room808, etc.)
- Feel like a real dev’s digital card — not a design gimmick
